It's finally, *FINALLY*, (going to be) here!

**Learn Atomic Design (and move beyond Bootstrap)** now starts on June 13th.



>The class will be taught via a partnership with Four Athens and Roundsphere.  The class will run six (6) weeks, and will take place every Monday and Thursday evening from 6:00-8:00. The first class of each week will be used to introduce and discuss a concept.  The second day will be more of a "lab" day, and the focus will be on application of that concept.  Classes will be taught at the Roundsphere Community space.  

Roundsphere's address is:

1 Press Place Suite 203<br/>
Athens, GA 30601

Note about the Fourth of July Holiday:
July 4th falls on a Monday, therefore class will be cancelled in observance of the holiday.  The last day of class will now be **Monday, July 25th** to account for the cancelled class.
You can register for the course online via the [Four Athens Classes page](https://www.fourathens.com/intermediateclasses/#tab-htmlcss).

Thanks again for your interest, and I look forward to seeing you on June 13th!
