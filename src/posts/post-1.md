It's finally here!

**Learn Atomic Design (and move beyond Bootstrap)** starts on June 6th.

The class will be taught via a partnership with Four Athens and Roundsphere.  The class will run six (6) weeks, and will take place every Monday and Thursday evening from 5:30-7:00. The first class of each week will be used to introduce and discuss a concept.  The second day will be more of a "lab" day, and the focus will be on application of that concept.  Classes will be taught at the Roundsphere Community space.  Roundsphere's address is:

1 Press Place Suite 203<br/>
Athens, GA 30601

For those that don't know, this course will be available online once this first session is complete. Four Athens students receive a discount of about 15% from the online version, as well as lifetime access to those materials.  Any feedback provided during the class is greatly appreciated and will be used to improve the course prior to launching online.

The only requirements for the course are a laptop and a code editor (Atom, Sublime, WebStorm, etc...).  It is highly recommended that you have some experience with the command line, SASS, Gulp (or Grunt), and Github; although please note that these are not strict requirements.

Stay tuned for more information about class topics and other announcements prior to June 6th.

Note about the Fourth of July Holiday:
July 4th falls on a Monday, therefore class will be cancelled in observance of the holiday.  The last day of class will be Monday, July 18th to account for the cancelled class.
You can register for the course online via the [Four Athens Classes page](https://www.fourathens.com/intermediateclasses/#tab-htmlcss).

Thanks again for your interest, and I look forward to seeing you on June 6th!
